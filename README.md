# Bungee

## Overview

To improve how I keep track of my university budget, I want a easier way to interface with my main Google Spreadsheet and friendly user interface.

My family and I use Spreadsheets for tracking spending, term based budgeting, taxes, and sharing our budgets with each other, so keeping the data synced with the spreadsheet is a requirement. Using a Spreadsheet as opposed to another database is a requirement since this solution must integrate seamlessly with our existing financial planning system.

I will be using a NodeJS [backend server](https://github.com/Kggupta/Bungee-Server), a set of google spreadsheets and this React Native application for development.

This app will be lighter weight than the Google Sheets App and will have dedicated statistics modules for my purposes.

## Demos

You will be able to try this app out yourself in the future. I'll be including a template Google Sheet budget and publishing this app to Expo so you can use it for your own purposes.

I also plan on posting this to both the Google Play and App Store once it's completed.

## Next Steps

After I complete the minimum viable product, I will add enhancements such as push notifications and emails when I reach a certain spending limit. I also want to link this app with my bank so that the google sheet can update on it's own when I make a purchase from my credit card.

I plan to connect my bank account - security is first and foremost, as it should always be.

As I come up with new ideas I'll continue adding features to help me manage my university budget.
