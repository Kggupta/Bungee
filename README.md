## Overview

To improve how I keep track of my university budget, I want a easier way to interface with my main Google Spreadsheet and friendly user interface.

I use Spreadsheets for my term based budgeting, taxes, and sharing my spending with my family so keeping the data synced with the spreadsheet is a requirement.

I will be using a MERN stack to accomplish this.
