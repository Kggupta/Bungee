# Bungee

## Overview

To improve how I keep track of my university budget, I want a easier way to interface with my main Google Spreadsheet and friendly user interface.

My family and I use Spreadsheets for tracking spending, term based budgeting, taxes, and sharing our budgets with the family so keeping the data synced with the spreadsheet is a requirement. Using a Spreadsheet as opposed to another database is a requirement since this solution must integrate seamlessly with our existing financial planning system.

I will be using a NodeJS [backend server](https://github.com/Kggupta/Bungee-Server), a set of google spreadsheets and this React Native application for development.

## Demos

You will be able to try this app out yourself in the future. I'll be including a template Google Sheet budget and publishing this app to Expo so you can use it for your own purposes.

I also plan on posting this to both the Google Play and App Store once it's completed.
